This is my game that I made for [The Arbitrary Game Jam #18](http://jams.gamejolt.io/tagjam18), it was created in about 72 hours. (I've been wanting to do a game jam for a long time, but things never worked out. So this is actually my first game jam game ever.)

The themes for this jam were:
* Slewed (Slang for "drunk")
* Defacement
* King Charles Spaniel

Additionally, the host, [@madmarcel](https://twitter.com/madmarcel), chose the following two bonus themes:
* Adolescence
* Gigantic

I opted to use all of the themes because the idea that started this game included most of them.

= Controls =
* WASD or Arrows to move
* Shift to sprint
* Space to start tagging (spray graffiti)

When tagging:
* Move the mouse to aim
* Left-click to spray paint
* Right-click to cycle colors
* Enter to finish tagging

= Story =
You play as Logan, a young **adolesent** who likes to get **slewed** by drinking **gigantic** beers and **deface** the insides of buildings with graffiti of his favorite type of dog, the **King Charles Spaniel**.

Of course, nothing so edgy and rebelious is ever that easy. You must also help Logan avoid guards inside the Gigantic TAG Beer factory, the latest canvas for his artwork.

Note that Logan can only paint while slewed. He also has trouble seeing the ideal locations for his artwork when he is sober, so you might not see them until he starts to get tipsy.

= Development =
I developed this game alone "from scratch" using C# and the SharpDX Toolkit. This was my first time really using the Sharp DX Toolkit, but I have a decent amount of experience with SharpDX in general.
All of the code was written specifically for this game, and all of the assets were created/found during the jam. You can find the third party assets at the end of this document.

Other tools used:
* Git
* Visual Studio 2013
* Photoshop CS5.5
* Blender

= Missing features =
Being a time-constrained game jam, I didn't quite finish everything I set out to do. In particular:
* Right now Logan is a boring gray cylinder, he needs a model of some sort.
* I never got around to adding guards :(
* There's only the one level
* My vision included lighting, so you'd have to explore more to find everything and there would be a stealth element to it. Right now the entire level is lit.
